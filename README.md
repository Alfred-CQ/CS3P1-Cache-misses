# CS3P1-Cache-misses
Execution of matrix multiplication algorithms using the valgrind and kcachegrind tools to evaluate their performance in terms of cache misses.

### Compile the project

To compile the project run (make sure you've got one version of g++ installed before) the following comands:

```
$ make all
$ bin/main
```

### Evaluating performance

Classical matrix multiplication, the three-loop nested version, was implemented and its performance was evaluated considering different matrix sizes.
